# Get_next_line
There is two versions of gnl in exam:
- one that returns a malloced string : char *get_next_line(int fd);
- one that returns an int depending on happened with the line read : int get_next_line(char **line);

I will implement both in two seperate files.
In exam you will only need to do one of the two so read your subject carefully to know which one is to do.
